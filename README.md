# Web-Design-Challenge
Created a website to publish my findings in the previous api-challenge. Has some difficulty with the navbar dropdown functioning on differnet charts, but otherwise had no problems with html. Some annyonances at the boilerplate code, not recognizing all of it, but it  works for now
